This is an excrept from the March 2023 Datathon Conducted by the DS3 society of University of Toronto Scarborough. 
The Datathon.R file includes the bulk of the code that is inspired by the tree based regression model used to analyze data and make prediction models
We found an API that had the basic framework to implement it in R and the specific implementation used by us is included in the Datathon.R file. 
We sorted the data in according to the predicted data sample file we recieved using a n-polynomial approximation used in standard normal model statistics 
The final results of our efforts are presented in the screenshort of a csv file that gives the predicted remaining battery life in cells manufactured in 
a particular factory.
